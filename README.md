## Workflow

On the home page there's a login/signup.

1. SignUp/ Login
2. Search for Users in the side drawer.
3. Click on the chat and start chatting.
4. When you're typing the other person would see a typing animation.
5. If the other user is not on the chat at the moment you're sending the message, the'll get a notification for the chats.
6. You can also view the profile on users by clicking on the top right corner (eye) of the chat.
7. You can also create group chats.
8. The creater would be the admin of the group chat.
9. The admin can add or remove members from their group chat.
10. The admin can also rename the group chat.



## Project Structure

I structured the application based on MVC Architecture. MVC stands for Model, View and Controller. This application presents a clear demarcation between the Model, View and Controller logics:

1. The `Model` logic is managed by Context API. Chat Provider decides what data the app should contain according to the current state. If the state of this data changes, then the `View` is notified.
2. The `View` logic is handled using `ChakraUI` Elements. It renders elements using `React` and by monitoring the changes in the `Model` logic or the store state.
3. The `Controller` contains the implemtation and logic to all the routes which ultimately updates the model and/or view in response to input from the users of the app.
